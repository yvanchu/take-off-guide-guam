## About the Authors

It will probably be useful to provide context for where we are from. We were all once in your positions. We all felt stupid when we started. 

### Yvan Chu

I am currently a software engineer at Microsoft, and I am a class of 2019 alumni from JFK. I went on 5 trips to the States that were fully paid for by another organization. Two of those trips were 6 week long college prep summer programs, and the other three were through JROTC and Robotics Club. I graduated Northwestern University in 2023 with a BS in Computer Science, and I fully covered college tuition and cost of living through the QuestBridge Scholarship and 4 other smaller scholarships. 

### You??

Please help contribute to this guide so more talented students from Guam can takeoff their college career!

## Opportunities within JFK
- JROTC
  - Drill Teams
  - Specialized Teams (Quiz bowl, Cyber Security, Marksmanship, etc.)
- Close Up

## Summer Programs
- TODO: add these info
  - [ ] target year
  - [ ] residential
  - [ ] includes airfare?
  - [ ] include whether someone from Guam has gone

- [Junior State of America](https://jsa.org/programs/doi-scholarships)
  - Department of Interior sponsors 38 high school students from U.S. Terriories to attend this 1-3 week summer program. I think there was at least 4 spots for students from Guam the year that I received an offer. 
- [Engineering Summer Program by UW Madision](https://engineering.wisc.edu/about/inclusion-equity-and-diversity/engineering-summer-program/)
  - Three week engineering summer program. This was where I first fell in love with the idea of going to college in the states during my rising junior summer. It was such a blast to live next to friends, learn about engineering, tour companies, and build cool shit. It used to be six weeks, but I guess now it has become two versions (remote and in person for three weeks). It does not include airfare. 
- [SAMS by Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/sams.html)
  - Six week program focused on math and science at Carnegie Mellon. They were able to provide full airfare assistance upon request. I did this during my senior summer, and this was more college prep focused. The people you met in this program were also more representative of the people who tend to attend selective universities.
- [Bovard Scholars by USC](https://bovardscholars.usc.edu)
  - Fully funded three week program on college prep at USC.
- MITES by MIT
  - Six week program focused on technology, engineering, adn science at MIT.

## Scholarships

TODO:
- [ ] Add in rough timelines for scholarships and college admissions
- [ ] consider adding in college prep timeline

### Financial Aid
- How much do you actually need to go off island?
  - Little to none actually. If you can get into top schools that generously meet 100% of student need in their financial aid polic. It should take nothing as long as you get accepted and apply to their financial aid. 
- Explaining the ecosystem
  - That being said, the selective institutions with generous financial is a specific tier of school in the states. I do not recommend taking on loans until you fully understand what it means if you were admitted to a school with worse or no financial aid. 
  - This is a big step for anyone. You should carefully consider the risks and rewards as well as your goals and priorities in life before committing. 

### [Local Scholarships](https://www.gdoe.net/District/Department/24-Scholarships/1645-Local-Scholarships.html)

These are especially nice because the competition is all on island. Also most of these scholarships pay out as a cash check. 

### National Scholarships

These are typically a lot more difficult, but they are also more prestigious and may come with in person interviews where you will get to represent Guam! Knowing that top schools already offer great financial aid, college applications should still be prioritized before these opportunities. 

- National Merit
- Gates
- QuestBridge
- Elks
- Jack Kent Cooke
- Burger King
- APIASF
- Lockheed Martin
- GE Reagan
- Wells Fargo Academic Leaders
- Horatio Alger
- Dell (by Upward Bound)

### Fly-ins

Fly-ins are basically a free field trips where a college flies you to go see the school for a few days. These should be the lowest priorities in your application because it is unlikely for a college to invest potentially 4-5 times the resources to fly out one student from Guam vs someone from state-side
- Case Western Reserve University
  - That being said, Case Western was generous enough to invite me once to their campus. It was super fun, and they had an AMAZING makerspace. 


- [ ] TODO: link more relevant information
- [ ] consider linking to college prep materials like SAT prep
- [ ] Micro-optimization once you get that offer like airline points, credit cards, and personal finance to make it work.
