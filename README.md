## About the Authors

It will probably be useful to provide context for where we are from. 

### Yvan Chu

I am currently a software engineer at Microsoft, and I am a class of 2019 alumni from JFK. I went on 4 trips to the States that were fully paid for by another organization. Two of those trips were 6 week long college prep summer programs, and the other two were through JROTC and Robotics Club. I graduated Northwestern University in 2023 with a BS in Computer Science, and I fully covered college tuition and cost of living through the QuestBridge Scholarship and 4 other smaller scholarships.
